            <h2>How We Got Here</h2>
            <p>We are a couple of guys who thought making beer sounded more fun than our previous jobs. The school theme comes from all of the school have made it through and all of the teachers in our lives. We started with a love for craft beer and an ambition to make our own recipes. We hope you enjoy our creations as much as we enjoyed making them!</p>
